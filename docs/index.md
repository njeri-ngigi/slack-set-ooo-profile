## Welcome to Slack OOO
This app changes a user profile to show a user is out of office by adding an OOO to their name, turning off notifications and adding a status to show when the user will be back from a break. The profile is reset after the time period selected by the user elapses. The user can cancel the OOO period whenever using the same slash command.
